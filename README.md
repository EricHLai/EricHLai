Hello, I'm 13 years old and I'm interested in the world of finance so I'm currently working on the CFA institute certificate, springpod and have tried investing simulators like Wall street survivor and Investopedia. Additionally, I am also doing leetcode and the silver CREST award.

I have also achieved grade 8 in piano and grade 7 in cello.
