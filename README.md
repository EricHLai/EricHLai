Hello, I'm 13 years old and I'm interested in the world of finance so I'm currently working on the CFA institute certificate, springpod and have tried investing simulators like Wall street survivor and Investopedia. I have also achieved diploma in piano and grade 8 in cello. Additionally, I am also doing leetcode and the silver CREST award.
